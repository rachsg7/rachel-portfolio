            <p>
                "Whatever you are doing - do mobile first." - Eric Schmidt</p>
            <p>Responsive retrofitting - take desktop and then work on mobile fitting</p>
            <p>Mobile first is time consuming and costly for a full rebuild</p>
            <p>Provides a better experience across devices Future friendly</p>
            <p>Things grow well from S->L</p>
            <p>Decrease steps if possible. 0 Steps is better than 5 steps</p>
            <p>Reachability matters - where thumbs go Speed matters - optimize or have drops in traffic and revenue</p>
            <p>Reduce image usage and use SVG/Webfonts Optimize</p>
            <p>CSS and JS files GZIP files Menu on bottom - easier to use Hamburger menu - not intuitive for everyone</p>
            <p>Forms: float labels, bigger buttons, bigger checkboxes, break into sections, enable autocomplete, space numbers in credit card info, give users the best keyboard for the form, don't list phone numbers as text</p>
            <p>No pop up ads!!! Make ads small and simple, not 40% of screen real estate. Window of content ad, simple effective, not blocking.</p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Regarding ads on websites - are pop ups/bigger ads worth more money? Is that why there are frequently so many?</li>
                <li>How does local storage work on web?</li>
