        <h2>Responsive Pokemon Type Advantage Chart</h2>
        <p>This is a project I have already been working on for a few semesters. I keep changing it as I learn more about CSS, but have minimal JavaScript so far. I would like to adapt it to add what I've learned in JavaScript so far this semester.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this is to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive Pokemon type chart. It will be responsive to how the user hovers over the chart if I can make it look good without being too janky, and when the user
                clicks on a specific type, it will reset the chart to include double type advantages and disadvantages. It will also have a quick tutorial the first time the user loads the page that session.</li>
            <li><b>Audience</b>: The audience for this app would be fans of Pokemon who want a better type advantage chart than what's out there, and will include double type advantages at the click of a button</li>
            <li><b>Data Sources</b>: The data sources will come from a local JSON file</li>
            <li><b>Initial module list</b>: Pokemon type object, Reset Values</li>
        </ol>
